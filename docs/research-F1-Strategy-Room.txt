## Deep Research Request: F1 Strategy Room

<context>
I'm building "F1 Strategy Room" — a web-based decision tool that helps hardcore F1 fans and content creators answer two key questions:
1. "What's the best pit/tyre strategy for this race?" (degradation modeling + strategy simulation)
2. "Where can we actually pass on this circuit?" (overtake opportunity mapping)

I have limited coding experience but strong domain knowledge. I need beginner-friendly research with actionable, implementation-ready insights. The MVP must be buildable with free tools (FastF1, Python, free hosting).

**Target Users:** Hardcore F1 fans wanting data-backed strategy insights; content creators/journalists needing shareable visuals and defensible analysis; fantasy F1 players seeking an edge.

**MVP Features:**
1. Tyre degradation model + stint pace curves (by compound, conditions)
2. Pit strategy simulator (rank strategies, optimal pit windows, undercut/overcut value)
3. Circuit overtake opportunity map (top passing zones with explanations)

**Constraints:** $0 budget, web app (desktop-first), resume-ready demo as first milestone.

### Key Questions to Answer:

**Data & Pipeline:**
1. How do I use FastF1 to extract tyre stint data, lap times, compound info, and weather? What's the simplest data pipeline for a beginner?
2. What data is available for identifying overtakes vs. position changes from pit stops? How reliable is it?
3. What's the best way to cache/store race data locally (parquet, SQLite, etc.) for fast iteration?

**Tyre Degradation Modeling:**
4. What are the simplest approaches to model tyre degradation (lap time vs. tyre age) that a beginner can implement? (Linear regression? Polynomial fit? Something else?)
5. How do I account for fuel load, track evolution, and traffic in a simple degradation model?
6. What existing open-source projects or notebooks model F1 tyre degradation I can learn from?

**Strategy Simulation:**
7. How do I build a basic pit strategy simulator that compares 1-stop vs. 2-stop strategies?
8. What are realistic values for pit stop time loss, in-lap/out-lap penalties by circuit?
9. How do I quantify "undercut effectiveness" and "overcut effectiveness" from historical data?
10. How can I add simple scenario toggles (dry/wet, safety car probability) without overcomplicating the MVP?

**Overtake Mapping:**
11. What data points best predict overtake likelihood at a corner/segment? (Braking intensity, DRS zones, speed delta, historical overtake counts?)
12. Are there existing datasets or methods for labeling overtakes in F1 telemetry?
13. What's the simplest way to visualize a track map with highlighted passing zones for a web app?

**Tech Stack & Deployment:**
14. For a beginner: Streamlit vs. building with React/Next.js + FastAPI — which path is faster to MVP? What are the tradeoffs?
15. What's the easiest way to deploy a Python-based F1 app for free (Streamlit Cloud, Render, Railway, etc.)?
16. What AI coding assistants or tools can help me build this faster? (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, v0.dev for UI?)

**Competitor & Inspiration:**
17. What existing F1 analytics projects, dashboards, or tools should I study for inspiration? (GitHub repos, Kaggle notebooks, blogs)
18. What do MultiViewer, f1-tempo, or other fan tools do well that I should emulate or avoid?
